            Provides functionality for encrypting several plaintext numbers into one ciphertext for improved memory efficiency and
            efficient vector operations (SIMD). Multiplying and adding such ciphertexts together performs the respective operation
            on each of the slots independently and simultaneously.

            Mathematically speaking, if polyModulus is x^n+1 and plainModulus is a prime number t such that 2n divides t-1, then
            integers modulo t contain a primitive 2n-th root of unity and the polynomial x^n+1 splits into n distinct linear
            factors as x^n+1 = (x-a_1)*...*(x-a_n) mod t, where the constants a_1, ..., a_n are all the distinct primitive 2n-th
            roots of unity in integers modulo t. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) states that the plaintext space Z_t[x]/(x^n+1)
            in this case is isomorphic (as an algebra) to the n-fold direct product of fields Z_t. The isomorphism is easy to
            compute explicitly in both directions, which is what an instance of this class can be used for. We refer to the
            modulus t as the slot modulus. Typically when an instance of PolyCRTBuilder is created, the slot modulus is set to be
            the plaintext modulus.

            The PolyCRTBuilder class is not thread-safe and a separate PolyCRTBuilder instance is needed for each potentially
            concurrent usage. However, certain important functions of PolyCRTBuilder are safe to call from several threads
            concurrently as long as the threads are guaranteed to never access the same slot simultaneously, or mutate 
            a <see cref="BigUInt"/> or <see cref="BigPoly"/> while another thread is using it, as these objects are not thread-safe.
